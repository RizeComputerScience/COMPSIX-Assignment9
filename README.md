# Assignment #9: Company Project Management API

A RESTful API for managing company projects and tasks with role-based access control.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Set up environment variables in `.env`
4. Setup the database: `npm run setup`
5. Seed the database: `npm run seed`
6. Start the server: `npm start`

## Current Status

This API is **partially implemented** and needs JWT authentication and role-based authorization added.

### What's Working:
- User registration and login (session-based)
- Full CRUD operations for projects and tasks
- Database relationships and seeding
- Basic authentication middleware

### What You Need to Implement:
- [ ] Add role field to User model
- [ ] Replace session authentication with JWT tokens
- [ ] Create role-based middleware functions
- [ ] Protect endpoints with appropriate role restrictions
- [ ] Test authorization flows

## API Endpoints

### Authentication

- `POST /api/login` - User login
- `POST /api/logout` - User logout

### Users

## Role Permissions (To Be Implemented)
